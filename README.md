## Setup

To get started, please [connect to NERSC system](https://docs.nersc.gov/connect/) and clone this repo and buildtest:

```
git clone https://github.com/buildtesters/buildtest
git clone https://github.com/buildtesters/buildtest-nersc
```

You will need python 3.8 or higher to [install buildtest](https://buildtest.readthedocs.io/en/devel/installing_buildtest.html), on Cori/Perlmutter this can be done by loading **python**
module and create a conda environment as shown below.

```console
module load python
conda create -n buildtest
conda activate buildtest
```

Now let's install buildtest, assuming you have cloned buildtest in $HOME directory source the setup script. For csh users you need to source **setup.csh**

```
source ~/buildtest/setup.sh

# csh users
source ~/buildtest/setup.csh
```

Next, navigate to `buildtest-nersc` directory and set environment `BUILDTEST_CONFIGFILE` to point to [config.yml](https://github.com/buildtesters/buildtest-nersc/blob/devel/config.yml) which is the configuration file for NERSC system.

```
cd buildtest-nersc
export BUILDTEST_CONFIGFILE=$(pwd)/config.yml
```

Make sure the configuration is valid, this can be done by running the following. 

```
buildtest config validate
```

buildtest will validate the configuration file with the JSON schema and report if configuration is valid. If you see an error during validation, please report an issue and 
try to fix the issue if you can.  

Please make sure you are using tip of [devel](https://github.com/buildtesters/buildtest/tree/devel) branch of buildtest when writing tests. You should sync your local devel branch with upstream
fork, for more details see [contributing guide](https://buildtest.readthedocs.io/en/devel/contributing/code_contribution_guide.html).

First time around you should discover all buildspecs this can be done via ``buildtest buildspec find``.  The command below will find
and validate all buildspecs in the **buildtest-nersc** repo and load them in buildspec cache. Note that one needs to specify `--root` to specify location where
all buildspecs are located. For more details see https://buildtest.readthedocs.io/en/devel/configuring_buildtest/overview.html#buildspec-roots 

```
cd buildtest-nersc
buildtest buildspec find --root buildspecs --rebuild -q
```

The buildspecs are loaded in buildspec cache file (JSON) that is used by `buildtest buildspec find` for querying cache. Subsequent runs will
read from cache. For more details see [buildspec interface](https://buildtest.readthedocs.io/en/devel/gettingstarted/buildspecs_interface.html).


## Building Tests

**Note: All tests are written in YAML using .yml extension**
   
To build tests use ``buildtest build`` command for example we build all tests in ``system`` directory as follows

```
buildtest build -b system/
```

You can specify multiple buildspecs either files or directory via ``-b`` option

```
buildtest build -b slurm/partition.yml -b slurmutils/
```

You can exclude a buildspec via `-x` option this behaves same way as `-b` option so you can specify
a directory or filepath which could be absolute path, or relative path. This is useful when
you want to run multiple tests grouped in directory but exclude a few.

```
buildtest build -b slurm -x slurm/sinfo.yml
```

buildtest can run tests via tags which can be useful when grouping tests, to see a list of available tags you
can run: ``buildtest buildspec find --tags``


For instance if you want to run all ``lustre`` tests you can run the following:

```
buildtest build --tags lustre
```

For more details on buildtest test please see the [buildtest tutorial](https://buildtest.readthedocs.io/en/devel/command_line_tutorial.html)

## Tags Breakdown

When you write buildspecs, please make sure you attach one or more `tags` to the test that way your test will get picked up during one of the CI checks. Shown
below is a summary of tag description

- **daily** - this tag is used for running daily system checks using gitlab CI. Tests should run relatively quick
- **system** - this tag is used for classifying all system tests that may include: system configuration, servers, network, cray tests. This tag should be used
- **slurm** - this tag is used for slurm test that includes slurm utility check, slurm controller, etc... This tag **shouldn't** be used for job submission that is managed by **jobs** tag. The `slurm` tag tests should be short running test that use a Local Executor.
- **jobs** - this tag is used for testing slurm policies by submitting jobs to scheduler.
- **compile** - this tag is used for compilation of application (OpenMP, MPI, OpenACC, CUDA, upc, bupc, etc...)
- **e4s** - this tag is used for running tests for E4S stack via `spack test` or [E4S Testsuite](https://github.com/E4S-Project/testsuite).
- **module** - this tag is used for testing module system
- **benchmark** - this tag is used for benchmark tests. This can be application benchmarks, mini-benchmarks, kernels, etc...

You can see breakdown of tags and buildspec summary with the following commands

```
buildtest buildspec summary
buildtest buildspec find --group-by-tags
```

## Querying Tests

You can use `buildtest report` and `buildtest inspect` to query tests. The commands differ slightly and data is
represented differently. The `buildtest report` command will show output in tabular form and only show some of the metadata,
if you want to access the entire test record use `buildtest inspect` command which displays the content in JSON format.
For more details on querying tests see https://buildtest.readthedocs.io/en/devel/gettingstarted/query_test_report.html


## CI Setup


Tests are run on schedule basis with one schedule corresponding to one gitlab job in [.gitlab-ci.yml](https://github.com/buildtesters/buildtest-nersc/blob/devel/.gitlab-ci.yml). The scheduled pipelines are configured in
https://software.nersc.gov/NERSC/buildtest-nersc/-/pipeline_schedules. Each schedule has a variable ``TESTNAME`` defined to control which pipeline
is run since we have multiple gitlab jobs. In the `.gitlab-ci.yml` we make use of conditional rules using [only](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/#onlyexcept-basic).

The scheduled jobs are run at different intervals (1x/day, 1x/week, etc...) at different times of day to avoid overloading the system. The gitlab jobs
will run jobs based on tags, alternately some tests may be defined by running all tests in a directory (`buildtest build -b apps`). If you want to add a new
scheduled job, please define a [new schedule](https://software.nersc.gov/NERSC/buildtest-nersc/-/pipeline_schedules/new) with an appropriate time. The
`target branch` should be `devel` and define a unique variable used to distinguish scheduled jobs. Next, create a job in `.gitlab-ci.yml` that references the scheduled job and define variable ``TESTNAME`` in the scheduled pipeline.

The gitlab runner configuration is stored in `$HOME/.gitlab-runner` including the jacamar configuration (`jacamar.toml`).

## Integrations

This project has integration with Slack to notify CI builds to [buildtest Slack](https://hpcbuildtest.slack.com) at **#buildtest-nersc** workspace. The integrations can be
found at https://software.nersc.gov/NERSC/buildtest-nersc/-/settings/integrations.

The gitlab project https://software.nersc.gov/NERSC/buildtest-nersc has setup Github Integration in https://software.nersc.gov/NERSC/buildtest-nersc/-/settings/repository which
is used for pull-mirroring and running CI/CD jobs. The pull-mirroring is configured in https://software.nersc.gov/NERSC/buildtest-nersc/-/settings/repository 
under **Mirroring Repositories**. 

## CDASH

buildtest will push test results to [CDASH](https://www.cdash.org/) server
at https://my.cdash.org/index.php?project=buildtest-nersc using `buildtest cdash upload` command.

## Contributing Guide

To contribute back you will want to make sure your buildspec is validated before you contribute back, this could be
done by running test manually `buildtest build` or see if buildspec is valid via `buildtest buildspec find`. It
would be good to run your test and make sure it is working as expected, you can view test detail using `buildtest inspect name <testname>` or `buildtest inspect query <testname>`. 

If you want to contribute your tests, please see [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/buildtesters/buildtest-nersc/blob/devel/CONTRIBUTING.md)
